  <h1>A Day at the St Louis Zoo!</h1>
  <h2>Morning at River's Edge</h2>

        <p><h3><strong>9:00am</strong></h3> Every zoo day, we begin by entering the south entrance and making our way to the Black Rhinocerous enclosure. I was able to see Moyo, the one-year-old Rhino. He is one of the animals that I most look forward to seeing at the St Louis Zoo!</p>

        <p><h3><strong>10:00am</strong></h3> Next, we continue our adventure in River's Edge and see the Hippopotamuses. Today, we saw several Hippopotamuses in the water and lounging. One hippopotamus was snoozing the day away.</p>

        <p><h3><strong>10:30am</strong></h3> After the hippos, we always visit the elephants. We saw one of the elephants giving herself a dust bath. Elephants are also one of my favorite animals to see at the St Louis Zoo for many reasons, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An elephant's trunk is used for eating, drinking, and dust bathing. Elephants also use their trunks for social behaviors, such as caressing and fighting.</li>
          <li>Elephants can run over 30 miles per hour at full speed.</li>
          <li>Elephants have the largest brains of any animal.</li>
          <li>A baby elephant is called a calf and is born weighing between 250 and 350 pounds.</li>
          <li>The oldest and most experienced female elephant usually leads the herd as the matriarch.</li>

        <p><h3><strong>11:00am</strong></h3> Finally, our last main stop in the River's Edge trail is the cheetah habitat. Recently, eight cheetah cubs were born at the St Louis Zoo! The cubs are quite big now. Before they were born, it was rare to get a good look at a cheetah in the habitat. Now, since the habitat is full of adventurous cubs, it is a lot easier to catch a glimpse.</p>
