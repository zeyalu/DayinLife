  <h1>A Day at the Zoo!</h1>
  <h2>Morning at River's Edge</h2>
  <table>

      <th>
        <p><h3><strong>9:00am</strong></h3> Every zoo day, we begin by entering the south entrance and making our way to the Black Rhinocerous enclosure. I was able to see Moyo, the one-year-old Rhino. He is one of the animals that I most look forward to seeing at the St Louis Zoo!</p>

        <p><h3><strong>10:00am</strong></h3> Next, we continue our adventure in River's Edge and see the Hippopotamuses. Today, we saw several Hippopotamuses in the water and lounging. One hippopotamus was snoozing the day away.</p>

        <p><h3><strong>10:30am</strong></h3> After the hippos, we always visit the elephants. We saw one of the elephants giving herself a dust bath. Elephants are also one of my favorite animals to see at the St Louis Zoo for many reasons, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An elephant's trunk is used for eating, drinking, and dust bathing. Elephants also use their trunks for social behaviors, such as caressing and fighting.</li>
          <li>Elephants can run over 30 miles per hour at full speed.</li>
          <li>Elephants have the largest brains of any animal.</li>
          <li>A baby elephant is called a calf and is born weighing between 250 and 350 pounds.</li>
          <li>The oldest and most experienced female elephant usually leads the herd as the matriarch.</li>
